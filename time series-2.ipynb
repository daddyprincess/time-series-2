    "Autoregression models, often referred to as AR models, are a class of statistical models used in time series analysis\n",
    "and forecasting. These models are particularly useful for modeling and predicting time-dependent data, where the values\n",
    "at each time point are dependent on previous observations. Autoregression models are based on the concept of \n",
    "autocorrelation, which is the correlation of a time series with its past values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how autoregression models are used in time series analysis and forecasting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Modeling Autocorrelation: Autoregressive models capture the relationship between a variable at a specific time \n",
    "(the \"current\" value) and its past values. This is expressed as a linear regression of the current value on one or\n",
    "more lagged values (previous observations). The \"order\" of the autoregressive model, denoted as AR(p), specifies how\n",
    "many lagged values are included in the regression equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, an AR(p) model can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Xt = c+ϕ1 Xt−1+ϕ2 Xt−2+…+ϕp Xt−p+ϵt\n",

    "    ~Xt−1,Xt−2,…,Xt−p are lagged values.\n",
    "    ~ϵt is white noise, representing random errors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.Estimation: The autoregressive coefficients (ϕ1,ϕ2,…,ϕp) are estimated from historical time series data using \n",
    "methods like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or least squares estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Model Selection: The appropriate order (p) of the autoregressive model is determined through model selection \n",

    "for white noise residuals, examining the autocorrelation of residuals, and conducting hypothesis tests to verify that\n",
    "the model's assumptions are met.\n",
